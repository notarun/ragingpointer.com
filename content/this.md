description: Why do I even have this website?

It's past midnight, and I did it again!

Renovated this website yet again, without writing a single blog post!
The last update was probably half a year ago.
That too was some styling updates.

I am getting tired of this.
Spending too much time on unnecessary stuff.

It has been like this since I bought this domain.
I have tried writing numerous times,
but I don't feel motivated enough to do so.

Maybe, I fear that no one will read it.

Or, probably deep down I know the truth, **I suck at writing**.
Writing makes me feel uncomfortable.

## But, I want to feel comfortable writing

And [learning is supposed to be uncomfortable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdOc2EnKGk8).

This reminds me of the time when I was starting to learn to program.
`loops`, `ternary`, `classes` all this made me feel lost, it all felt like magic.

But, now after some practice and regular efforts,
I write code for a living.

## Let's give it another shot!

Recently, I have switched jobs, and I am working full-time remote now.
Which gives me a little extra time than I before had.

I don't expect to publish a long blog post daily.
I will try to be regular, even if the content is "as SEO people like to call it" *THIN*.

It doesn't matter
* If no one is reading my writings.
* If the content could have been a tweet.
* If my blogs do not appear on the search engine's first page.

As long as I am improving.
I will keep doing it.
That is the main goal.

This is a small step toward making myself comfortable in writing.
