So, I rewrote the code to generate this blog, again.
This time, I used `jq`, `pandoc` and `Makefile` instead of `11ty`.
I came across this
[blog post](https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2018/01/this-website-is-a-makefile/)
by John Hawthorn, and it inspired me to use a `Makefile` in my code.

If it is something of your interest, source code is available at
[github](https://github.com/notarun/ragingpointer.com).

## Let's give it another shot!

After so many failed attempts to write a blog post,
here I am giving it another shot.
I hope to write (*dump*) my notes and thoughts semi-regularly here.

Fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž
